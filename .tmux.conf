##### Basic Usage #####

# First things first: Remap the prefix key to reduce conflicts with
# Emacs!
unbind C-b

# By default, we'll use the backtick as the prefix key.
set -g prefix '`' ; bind '`' send-prefix

# Don't run the login shell by default when we start.
set -g default-command "${SHELL}"

# Reload tmux config so we can pick up changes to this file without
# needing to restart tmux
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Reloaded tmux configuration!"

# Index windows from 1, not 0, so they line up a little better with
# the order of the number keys on the keyboard
set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# Have messages display until a key is pressed. default: 750 ms
set -g display-time 0
# Reduce the command delay time to something a bit shorter
set -sg escape-time 0
# Extend the repeat interval for repeatable commands (e.g.,
# resize-pane)
set -sg repeat-time 1000
# Refresh the status bar every second.
set -g status-interval 1

# Default is 2000
set -g history-limit 100000

# When a smaller terminal connects to a tmux client, it shrinks to fit
# it.  The clients attached with bigger displays see this constrained
# view.  aggressive-resize makes it such that the window is only
# resized if the smaller client is actively looking at it.
setw -g aggressive-resize on

##### Scrollback Navigation #####

# Use emacs-style navigation in Copy mode (which is also scrollback
# mode)
setw -g mode-keys emacs

##### Window/Pane Management #####

# Rebind the default bindings to make the new working directory the
# same as whatever pane we're coming from.
bind c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind '"' split-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind % split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'

# Split windows more intuitively (except for the fact that tmux
# doesn't understand that a horizontal split means the pane should be
# split down the middle horizontally, and likewise for a vertical
# split).
bind | split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}' # horizontal columns
bind - split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}' # vertical rows

# # Quickly jump between two windows
# bind i last-window

# # Resizing panes
# bind -r H resize-pane -L 5
# bind -r J resize-pane -D 5
# bind -r K resize-pane -U 5
# bind -r L resize-pane -R 5

# Renumber windows
bind m command-prompt -p "move window to:" "move-window -t '%%'"

##### Colors #####
# Ensure we're using 256 colors
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

set -g set-titles on

source-file ~/.tmux/theme_berquist.conf

# Monitor windows for activity. Highlight the status line, but don't
# display a status line message.
setw -g monitor-activity on
set -g visual-activity off

### Unused bits go below here...

# # Status bar has a dim gray background
# set -g status-bg colour234
# set -g status-fg colour255
# # Left shows the session name, in blue
# set -g status-left-bg default
# set -g status-left-fg colour74

# xclip support (commented as this often doesn't make sense on remote servers)
# bind C-c run "tmux save-buffer - / xclip -i -sel clipboard"
# bind C-v run "tmux set-buffer \"$(xclip -o -sel clipboard)\"; tmux paste-buffer"

# set up alias for turning on logging
# bind P pipe-pane -o "cat >>~/#W.log" \; display "Toggled logging to ~/#W.log"

# set up aliases for temporarily maximizing panes
# unbind Up
# bind Up new-window -d -n tmp \; swap-pane -s tmp.1 \; select-window -t tmp
# unbind Down
# bind Down last-window \; swap-pane -s tmp.1 \; kill-window -t tmp

# Are we running on a Mac? Use some extra options.
if-shell 'test "$(uname)" = "Darwin"' 'source ~/.tmux/osx.conf'
