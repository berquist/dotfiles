* dotfiles

The basic steps are:
- If on macOS, install Homebrew.
- Install Ansible.
- Install Ansible roles from Galaxy.
- Install software through the package manager.
- Install GitHub repos and programming languages.
- Deploy dotfiles.

To perform these steps,
#+begin_src bash
bash ./bootstrap_package_installation.bash
# depending on the OS; this step isn't smart yet
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_packages_{arch,homebrew}.yaml
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_all.yaml
#+end_src
