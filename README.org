* dotfiles

Don't forget =--recurse-submodules= when cloning!

The basic steps are:
- If on macOS, install Homebrew.
- Install Ansible.
- Install Ansible roles from Galaxy.
- Install software through the package manager.
- Install GitHub repos and programming languages.
- Deploy dotfiles.
- Set the shell to zsh.

To perform these steps,
#+begin_src bash
bash ./bootstrap_package_installation.bash
# depending on the OS; this step isn't smart yet
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_packages_{arch,popos}.yaml -b -K
# or
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_packages_homebrew.yaml
# then
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_all_system.yaml -b -K
ansible-playbook ./ansible/install_all.yaml
ansible-playbook ./ansible/set_shell.yaml -b -K
#+end_src
